"""CITES Trade Database: where traded wildlife comes from and where it goes.

Download the full database from https://trade.cites.org/ (``Download`` → full
database, a zip of CSVs, updated yearly), unzip it anywhere, and run

    wildtrace cites path/to/Trade_database_download_vYYYY.1

The loader streams every shipment worldwide, maps taxa onto the lexicon's species
groups, and aggregates two layers for web/data/flows.json:

* seized: shipments with Source code ``I`` (confiscated or seized specimens), kept
  as origin → exporter → importer, the closest open record of illegal flows;
* declared: all other reported trade, exporter → importer, the legal baseline.

Individual shipments and permit identifiers are never published, only counts.
