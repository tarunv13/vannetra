/* Tours: the main walkthrough, plus a short tour inside every section.
 *
 * The main tour runs once for a first-time reader (and from the Tour menu). Each section (Flows,
 * Zoonoses, Investigate and its import tab, Analysis, the heatmap, Network, Table, Methods) has
 * its own short tour that runs the first time the reader opens it, unless they switched section
 * tips off. Every card carries that switch; the Tour button opens a menu to replay any tour.
 *
 * Each step spotlights a real element (a hole cut in a dimming overlay, so the thing explained is
 * the live interface) and places its card where there is room. Steps whose element is not on
 * screen are skipped. Keyboard: → or Enter next, ← back, Esc to leave; focus stays in the card.
